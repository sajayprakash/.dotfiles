# Dotfiles
Dotfiles are the customization files (their filenames usually begin with a period) that are used to personalize your GNU/Linux or other Unix-based systems. This repository contains my personal dotfiles.
These dotfiles are managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

# Usage
- Install [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) on your system.
- Git clone this repo - ```https://github.com/sajayprakash/.dotfiles.git```
- ```cd .dotfiles``` and run ```stow *```
- This will create symlinks to the config files in their appropriate paths.
